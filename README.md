# 🌌 Exoplanet EDA with 3D Visualizations

Exploring **5,000+ exoplanets** using Python, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and **stunning 3D visualizations**.  
This project leverages **NASA’s Exoplanet Archive** to uncover trends, identify extreme worlds, and visualize the rare **habitable zone planets** in a way that feels like traveling through the galaxy.

---

## 📊 Project Highlights
- Cleaned and analyzed **NASA’s Exoplanet Archive dataset**
- Explored **discovery trends**, **planetary sizes**, and **orbital distances**
- Created **interactive 3D visualizations** (shared as screenshots)
- Highlighted the **rarity of habitable-zone exoplanets**
